"""n-puzzle Board implementation and utilities.

This module implements an immutable, memory-efficient representation of the n-puzzle
(sliding tile puzzle) and a small set of helpers used by the experimental harness.

Key design points
-----------------
- Board instances are immutable (a frozen dataclass with ``slots=True``). This makes
    them hashable and cheap to copy by reference when used as keys in dictionaries or
    sets (useful for search algorithms).
- The board is stored as a flat 1-D tuple ``tiles`` of length ``n*n`` where the
    blank tile is represented by 0. The index of the blank is cached in ``zero`` for
    fast neighbor generation.
- Methods return new ``Board`` objects instead of mutating state. The module
    provides convenience constructors and utilities for testing and interactive use.

API (at-a-glance)
------------------
- class Board(n, tiles, zero):
    - Board.goal(n) -> Board
        Return solved board for size n. O(n^2) time to construct.
    - Board.from_flat(n, flat) -> Board
        Validate and return board from flat sequence. O(n^2).
    - Board.from_rows(rows) -> Board
        Build board from nested list.
    - Board.is_goal() -> bool
        True if board equals goal state. O(1) tuple comparison.
    - Board.is_solvable() -> bool
        Determine solvability using inversion counts (standard rule). O(n^2).
    - Board.visualize() -> str
        Return an ASCII multi-line representation for printing. O(n^2).
    - Board.neighbors() -> Iterator[Board]
        Yield neighbor boards by sliding the blank. Generates up to 4 neighbors. O(n^2)
        per neighbor creation (cost copies the tile tuple).
    - Board.randomize(k, seed=None) -> Board
        Produce a board reachable from this one after k random legal moves.

- module-level helpers:
    - manual_move(board, direction) -> Board
        Apply a single move 'U','D','L','R' to the given board (raises if illegal).
    - manual_play(n=3, r=10)
        Small interactive console to play the puzzle (helpful for manual testing).

Examples

        >>> b = Board.goal(3)
        >>> print(b.visualize())
         1  2  3
         4  5  6
         7  8  X

        # randomize 10 legal moves from the goal (deterministic with seed)
        >>> r = b.randomize(10, seed=42)

Notes
-----
- All random scrambles generated by :meth:`randomize` are reachable from the goal
    (and therefore solvable) because they are produced by applying legal moves to
    the goal state.
- The :meth:`is_solvable` method implements standard inversion-count rules for
    determining solvability.
